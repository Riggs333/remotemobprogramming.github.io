# How to be a Great Typist

## Be reactive.
If you don't get any commands, do nothing - just listen. 
Move your hands away from mouse and keyboard. 
Meditate to the blinking of your cursor. 
Cherish this moment. 
Fight the urge to "help" them by joining in the discussion, or even worse, doing stuff proactively.
If you really want to join the discussion, trigger a handover to the next typist.

## Be slow.
Slow down, so everybody in the rest of the team can follow what you are doing. 
This includes moving your mouse cursor, changing windows, switching tabs, or pressing keyboard shortcuts.
Make it easy to follow what and how you are doing things.

## Be calm.
Resist pressure from the rest of your team.
Stay calm even in then.
Tell them to slow down with their commands.
Tell them to give you space and freedom to act and breath.
