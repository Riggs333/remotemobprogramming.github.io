## How to act as a typist

The typist shares the screen everybody is looking at.
This means the typist has power. 
[But with great power comes great responsibility.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility)
Here's how to be a responsible typist.

### Be reactive.
If you don't get any commands, do nothing - just listen. 
Move your hands away from mouse and keyboard. 
Meditate to the blinking of your cursor. 
Cherish this moment. 
Fight the urge to join the discussion of the *rest of the team*.
If it helps, just mute yourself.
You know it will we over in a few minutes.
But if you loose that fight, trigger a handover to the next typist.

### Be patient.
You might become impatient when there are no (clear) commands.
You can ask "what should I do next?" in those cases, but it's probably better to simply wait doing nothing instead.
You will get commands at some point afterall.

### Be slow.
Slow down, so everybody in the *rest of the team* can follow what you are doing. 
This includes moving your mouse cursor, changing windows, switching tabs, or pressing keyboard shortcuts.
Make it easy to follow what and how you are doing things.
So with you going slowly, the whole team can go fast.

### Be calm.
Although the *rest of your team* should be patient with you, it sometimes happens that you might feel pressured from the *rest of your team* for following their commands too slow.
Just stay calm and tell them to slow down with their commands.
Tell them to give you space and freedom to act and breath.
It's okay to stand your ground, even necessary.

### Be private.
Disable any notifications.
The *rest of the team* doesn't want to get a sneak preview of your instant messages or emails.

### Be confident.
If you get contradicting commands, pause.
Don't select one command over another on your own.
Don't selectively ignore commands.
Just ask the *rest of the team* what you should do.

### Be attentive.
Listen closely what the *rest of the team* discuss.
Be ready to support them anytime.
Don't distract yourself with email, Twitter or Slack.

### Be disciplined.
Rotation is key to the success of working together.
Make sure to hand over to the next typist on time.
Don't go for the famous last words of "let me finish this real quick".

### Be prepared.
Try to be prepared so when your time as a typist comes, you can immediately implement the commands from the *rest of the team*.
So start up your IDE, checkout the project you're currently working on, let your build system download the internet, and your IDE create those annoying but really helpful indexes.
Also, configure your IDE: enable line numbers, increase font size, and activate auto-save (looking at you, VS Code).
