## How to act as a typist

The typist shares the screen everybody is looking at.
This means the typist has power. 
[But with great power comes great responsibility.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility)
Here's how to be a responsible typist.

### Be reactive.
If you don't get any commands, do nothing - just listen. 
Move your hands away from mouse and keyboard. 
Meditate to the blinking of your cursor. 
Cherish this moment. 
Fight the urge to talk to the *rest of the team* by joining in the discussion.
If it helps, just mute yourself.
But if you really want to join the discussion, trigger a handover to the next typist.

### Be patient.
You might become impatient when there are no (clear) commands.
You can ask "what should I do next?" in those cases, but it's probably better to simply wait doing nothing instead.
You will get commands at some point afterall.

### Be slow.
Slow down, so everybody in the *rest of the team* can follow what you are doing. 
This includes moving your mouse cursor, changing windows, switching tabs, or pressing keyboard shortcuts.
Make it easy to follow what and how you are doing things.

### Be calm.
Stay calm even when you feel pressure from the *rest of your team* for being too slow.
Tell them to slow down with their commands.
Tell them to give you space and freedom to act and breath.

### Be private.
Disable any notifications.
The *rest of the team* doesn't want to get a sneak preview of your instant messages or emails.

### Be confident.
If you get contradicting commands, pause.
Don't select one command over another on your own.
Don't selectively ignore commands.
Just ask the *rest of the team* what you should do.

### Be attentive.
Listen closely what the *rest of the team* discuss.
Be ready to support them anytime.
Don't distract yourself with email, Twitter or Slack.

### Be disciplined.
Rotation is key to the success of working together.
Make sure to hand over to the next typist on time.
Don't go for the famous last words of "let me finish this real quick".


## How to act in the rest of the team


### Be intentional.
Communicate the intent.
Be clear about the why to the typist.
A smart typist with system knowledge might already start implementing just with the why.

### Be concise of location.
Communicate location using absolutes like file names, class names, or line numbers.
Avoid relative location like "move a little bit more up; no, that was too far, go down a little bit more, ...".

### Be polite.
It's not what you say, but how you say it.
So say "Can you go to line 45, please?".

### Be patient.
Be patient when giving the typist commands.
*You* are responsible that the typist feels comfortable.

### Be unobtrusive.
Accept the freedom of the typist.
Before giving advice, make sure the typist is open for it.
A typical example is when the typist is doing a refactoring manually and you know how to do this with IDE functions only.
Tell the typist you have a suggestion on doing this differently, and ask them if they would like to know it - but be prepared to accept a no as an answer.

### Be inclusive.
Make sure that you don't dominate the *rest of the team*.
If you realize you're talking too much, you might be leading by giving command over command. 
Think about switching to *lead with questions* instead.
Asking questions will automatically reduce your talking time and opens space for others to join in and share their solution approaches.

### Be emphatic.
Make sure everybody in video call is okay.
