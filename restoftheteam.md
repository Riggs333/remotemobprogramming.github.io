## *DRAFT* How to act towards the typist

The rest of the team develop software, using the [typist](typist) as a smart voice-controlled input device.
This is how to communicate and act towards the typist.

### Be intentional.
Communicate the intent.
Be clear about the why to the typist.
A smart typist with system knowledge might already start implementing just with the why.

### Be accurate.
Communicate location accurately using absolutes like file names, class names, or line numbers.
Avoid relative location like "move a little bit more up; no, that was too far, go down a little bit more, ...".

### Be polite.
It's not what you say, but how you say it.
So say "Can you go to line 45, please?".

### Be patient.
Be patient when giving the typist commands.
*You* are responsible that the typist feels comfortable.
Give the typist time to think and fix their own mistakes like missing semi colons, too many parentheses, or simple typos.

### Be unobtrusive.
Accept the freedom of the typist.
Before giving advice, make sure the typist is open for it.
A typical example is when the typist is doing a refactoring manually and you know how to do this with IDE functions only.
Tell the typist you have a suggestion on doing this differently, and ask them if they would like to know it - but be prepared to accept a no as an answer.
The best case would be that you never give advice unsolicited, but the typist has an inkling that IDE refactorings might help here and asks you to guide them.

### Be united.
Speak with one voice.
Don't send conflicting commands.
Normally, a temporary spokesperson emerges naturally.
If this doesn't work, you can agree upon a temporary spokesperson - and they might even rotate alongside the typist.

## *DRAFT* How to act in the rest of the team

### Be inclusive.
Make sure that you don't dominate the *rest of the team*.
If you realize you're talking too much, you might be leading by giving command over command. 
Think about switching to *lead with questions* instead.
Asking questions will automatically reduce your talking time and opens space for others to join in and share their solution approaches.

### Be emphatic.
Make sure everybody in video call is okay.
